### Instruction
- Make sure you understand the task goal to avoid wrong actions.
- Make sure you carefully examine the the current screenshot. Sometimes the summarized history might not be reliable, over-claiming some effects.
- For requests that are questions (or chat messages), remember to use the `CallUser` action to reply to user explicitly before finishing! Then, after you have replied, use the Finished action if the goal is achieved.
- Consider exploring the screen by using the `scroll` action with different directions to reveal additional content.
- To copy some text: first select the exact text you want to copy, which usually also brings up the text selection bar, then click the `copy` button in bar.
- To paste text into a text box, first long press the text box, then usually the text selection bar will appear with a `paste` button in it.
